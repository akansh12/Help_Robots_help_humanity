    "# Deep Time Series Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The time series classification problem seems to be a great choice to apply Deep Learning models. However, even deep models cannot magically give you good results if the data wasn't propertly prepared. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [CareerCon 2019 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019) was all about time series classification. In [one of my previous kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/purplejester/a-simple-lstm-based-time-series-classifier), I've tried to apply LSTM model to the dataset and didn't get too impressive accuracy. Also, I was experimenting with 1-d convolutions but again without any luck. So finally, I decided to go with [a more simple apporach](https://www.kaggle.com/purplejester/the-best-friend-of-an-alchemist). Nevertheless, when the competition was ended, [one of the best solutions](https://www.kaggle.com/prith189/starter-code-for-3rd-place-solution) implemented by [prith189](https://www.kaggle.com/prith189) uses Deep Learning to achieve a decent result on both public and private leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to use PyTorch to create a clone of the mentioned solution and see if we can improve it a bit using modern training techniques.\n",

Therefore, our function instead of returning absolute learning rates works as a _scaler_ that modifies the base value as training iterations increase."

    "The Deep Learning models are very powerful solutions to a wide range of Data Science projects. However, even these powerful solutions can't show good results if used naively and without additional efforts to make a proper preparation of the data. The more work we spend to help our models, the better results they will show."
